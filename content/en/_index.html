summary: >-
  <p>Our  Sufficiency Library is a collaborative, open wiki-style platform  overseen by a scientific steering committee in charge of the initial  curation of resources. It hosts a multimedia repository for  sufficiency-related data, publications, analyses, case studies, business  models, and ongoing research projects. This wealth of knowledge is  available to everyone to inform and inspire sustainable practices. It is  also a space for the documentation of existing projects, assessing  impact and identifying best practices.</p>
