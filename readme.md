### Scientific discipline

Zotero na

- Building energy policies
- Transport energy policy
- Energy policy 
- Agriculture

Data management: this is going to be a problem, as there is no international consistency.
Transport energy policy is not a discipline in France (https://conseil-national-des-universites.fr/cnu/).
Do we have a list?

### Geographical scope

Zotero na

- France
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Germany
- 54 High income countries
- World

Data management: this is usable only as a text, therefore not browsable. 
If it is intended to be used as a browsable or filterable data, it must be lists of countries, and "54 countries" must list them all.

### What sufficiency mentioned in the paper

Zotero na

- Yes
- No

Data management: why do we answer by "yes" or "no" to a question starting with "what"?

### Sector

Zotero tag `sec_*`, or Zotero subcollections

- Building
- Transport 
- Agriculture
- Fashion

Data management: we need to choose.

### Sub-sector

Zotero tag `sub_*`, or Zotero subcollections

- Residential buildings
- Mobility of individuals
- Food production 
- Clothing

Data management: we need to choose.

### Policy area

Zotero tag `pol_*`

- Not identified
- Environment, Transport
- Energy policy
- Housing policy
- Transport policy 
- Energy Policy
- Agriculture policies
- Climate policies
- Health policies
- Land use policies

Data management: the taxonomy needs consistency.
It's not possible to have a policy named "Environment, Transport", it's 2.
It's not possible to have sometimes "policy", sometimes "Policy", sometimes "policies".

### Policy instrument

No example. What is it?

### Policy measure

- Setting car sharing organization in urbanely dense areas 

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Policy intervention

- A cap on floor area per capita
- Housing size
- Number of appliances
- Size of appliances
- Mode shift, avoided travers, 
- Downsizing houses
- Cycling
- Shift from animal-based foods to plant-based foods

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Type of quantification

- Bottom-up modelling of energy in the use phase
- Life-cycle assessment
- Regression analysis
- Smoothing techniques
- SMRIO model

Data management: the first one seems to imply it's text. 
Is there a closed list of types?

### Quantification results
- GHG emission reduced by 90% in 2050 compared to super efficient scenario
- 5% savings in all household transport-related energy use and GHG emissions in the U.S.
- Up to 27% of energy savings per households
- Reduce annual agricultural production emissions of high-income nations’ diets by 61% while sequestering
as much as 98.3 (55.6–143.7) GtCO2 equivalent, equal to approximately 14 years of current global agricultural emissions until
natural vegetation matures.

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Quantification gaps	

- Not all sufficiency measures can be modelled
- Land use
- Energy savings
- GHG emissions reduction
- Health impacts

Data management: the first one seems to imply it's text. 
Is there a closed list of types?

### Timeline

- 2015-2050
- Not identified
- 1996-2018

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Cost of policy intervention
No example. What is it?

### How the policy intervention is financed
No example. What is it?

### Institutional arrangement
No example. What is it?

### Stakeholders involved
No example. What is it?

### Stakeholders impacted
No example. What is it?

### Natural resources impacted

- Energy 
- Materials
- Land
- Land use

Data management: needs consistency. 
Do we have a closed list?

### Wellbeing (type and impact)

- Not identified
- Social benefits
- Health benefits
- Costs savings

Data management: needs consistency. 
Do we have a closed list?

### Equity consideration

- Not identified
- Cycling is unbalanced and largely a consequence of highly educated people in cities who now cycle twice as much 
- Equal per capita CDR responsibilities

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Planetary boundaries impacted

- Land use
- Climate change

Data management: needs consistency. 
Do we have a closed list?
