### Policy instrument

No example. What is it?

### Policy measure

- Setting car sharing organization in urbanely dense areas 

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Policy intervention

- A cap on floor area per capita
- Housing size
- Number of appliances
- Size of appliances
- Mode shift, avoided travers, 
- Downsizing houses
- Cycling
- Shift from animal-based foods to plant-based foods

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Type of quantification

- Bottom-up modelling of energy in the use phase
- Life-cycle assessment
- Regression analysis
- Smoothing techniques
- SMRIO model

Data management: the first one seems to imply it's text. 
Is there a closed list of types?

### Quantification results
- GHG emission reduced by 90% in 2050 compared to super efficient scenario
- 5% savings in all household transport-related energy use and GHG emissions in the U.S.
- Up to 27% of energy savings per households
- Reduce annual agricultural production emissions of high-income nations’ diets by 61% while sequestering
as much as 98.3 (55.6–143.7) GtCO2 equivalent, equal to approximately 14 years of current global agricultural emissions until
natural vegetation matures.

Data management: this is not a taxonomy, it must be text.

### Quantification gaps	

- Not all sufficiency measures can be modelled
- Land use
- Energy savings
- GHG emissions reduction
- Health impacts

Data management: the first one seems to imply it's text. 
Is there a closed list of types?
